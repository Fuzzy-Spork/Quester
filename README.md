# quester

Quester is our answer to the Hack 20 Flutter Hackathon. Quester sets you on a path of doing small and easy, yet heavily contributing missions for Saving the Planet. Each completed mission awards you with, *drum roll*, Experience Points! XP allows you to level up and brag about how you are taking steps for Saving the Planet!


## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application.
To use this app, install the Quester.apk file on your android phone. To test this app on iOS, clone this repository on your mac device, and run the command:
